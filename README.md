# Polarion ALM extension to compare objects of different types

This Polarion extension provides functionality of diffing:
* fields of 2 documents (either different or the same in different revisions)
* work items of 2 documents (also either of different documents or of the same in different revisions)
* arbitrary set of work items in one project with their counterpart work items from another project

...and then to merge selected diffs in any direction.

In case of diffing work items, appropriate counterpart work items (from another document or another project) are always seeking
by selected link role.

## Quick start

The latest version of the extension can be downloaded from the [releases page](../../releases/latest) and installed to Polarion instance without needs to be compiled from the sources.
The extension should be copied to `<polarion_home>/polarion/extensions/ch.sbb.polarion.extension.diff-tool/eclipse/plugins` and changes will take effect after Polarion restart.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't forget to clear `<polarion_home>/data/workspace/.config` folder after extension installation/update to make it work properly.

## Polarion configuration

### Documents comparison form to appear on a Document's properties pane

1. Open a project where you wish Documents comparison to be available
2. On the top of the project's navigation pane click âš™ (Actions) âž™ ðŸ”§ Administration. Project's administration page will be opened.
3. On the administration's navigation pane select Documents & Pages âž™ Document Properties Sidebar.
4. In opened Edit Project Configuration editor find `sections`-element:
   ```xml
   â€¦
   <sections>
     <section id="fields"/>
     â€¦
   </sections>
   â€¦
   ```
5. And insert following new line inside this element:
   ```xml
   â€¦
   <extension id="diff-tool" label="Documents Comparison" />
   â€¦
   ```
6. Save changes by clicking ðŸ’¾ Save

### Documents copy form to appear on a Document's properties pane
Repeat the instructions above except that on the step 5 use the following line:
   ```xml
   â€¦
   <extension id="copy-tool" label="Documents Copy" />
   â€¦
   ```

### Fine-tuning the communication between Polarion and Diff Tool extension

The Diff Tool UI makes numerous requests to Polarion using the REST API to retrieve information about documents and their workitems. These requests can be processed in parallel to improve performance.
The number of parallel requests can be configured in `polarion.properties` file:

```properties
ch.sbb.polarion.extension.diff-tool.chunk.size=2
```

Default value is `2`. Increasing this value may speed up the process but can also overload your Polarion server.

## Extension Configuration

1. On the top of the project's navigation pane click âš™ (Actions) âž™ ðŸ”§ Administration. Project's administration page will be opened.
2. On the administration's navigation pane select `Diff Tool`. There are 2 sub-menus with different configuration options for Diff Tool.
3. They have either `Quick Help` section with short description or their content is self-evident.
4. To change configuration of Diff Tool extension just edit corresponding section and press `Save` button.

## Usage

1. Open a document in Polarion.
2. In the toolbar choose Show Sidebar âž™ Document Properties.
3. Choose another document and desired options in the `Diff Tool` block and click `Compare`.
4. Another tab will be opened in browser listing documents differences. Later you can select certain differences and merge them in any direction.

## REST API

This extension provides REST API. OpenAPI Specification can be obtained [here](docs/openapi.json).

## Calling diff methods from Velocity Context

`diffText` and `diffHtml` functions are available in Velocity context referenced by `$diffTool` variable.
Example:

```velocity
$diffTool.diffText("Some text", "Some another text").getResult()
```

or

```velocity
$diffTool.diffHtml("<html><body><div>Some text</div></body></html>", "<html><body><div>Some another text</div></body></html>").getResult()
```

Also, `isDifferent` can be used if you need to show something specific for cases when the values are the same:

```velocity
#set($diffResult = $diffTool.diffText("Some text", "Some text"))
#if($diffResult.isDifferent())
  $diffResult.getResult()
#else
  No changes
#end
```
